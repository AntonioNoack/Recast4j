#Recast4j

Port of [Recast4j](https://github.com/ppiastucki/recast4j), which itself is a Java port of [Recast Navigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation),
but with JOML and reduced allocations (to reduce memory pressure); maybe will be Kotlin in the future

I might additionally replace JOML with a custom JOML in the future, because 1.10 is missing AABB, Planes and such

I have no prior experience with Recast, so I may change interfaces
