#Recast4k

Port of [Recast4j](https://github.com/ppiastucki/recast4j), which itself is a Java port of [Recast Navigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation),
but with JOML/[KOML](https://github.com/AntonioNoack/RemsEngine/tree/master/KOML), reduced allocations (to reduce memory pressure), and translated from Java to Kotlin, so it can be used on the web.

I have no prior experience with Recast, so I may change interfaces
